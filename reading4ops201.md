# How to Troubleshoot Notes
## Why This Matters
-Troubleshooting matters because it is an efficient way to seek, understand, and solve a problem. It is important to have a process in which you can solve a problem in the fastest time possible, categorizing what the issue is from simple to complicated. This makes it easy to go through what could be causing the problem instead of randomly guessing. Documentaion is key to keeping track of what is going on and what has already been tested.
## Analogy
-In the army, we had to troubleshoot any malfunctions with our weapon systems. There were acronyms, such as POPS or RTB. these were for immediate actions. Something that could be solved quickly like a loose casing or debri that could easily be ejected. Remedial action required more care with the weapon, using tools to pull out stuck debri, checking all the parts to make sure everything was functioning properly. Different levels of effort and a bit more detail into what could be the problem. There were also forms that had the history of the weapons problems, damage, details that would warrant different parts being replaced or the person the weapon was issued to. Kind of like a ticket, or some form of documentation.
