# SSD Data Recovery Best Practices Notes
## Why this matters
Recovering data is extremely important to any user. Understanding the methodologies to fix a storage device or restoring data is critical to fixing any mistake
# SSD failing?:
- An SSD suffering from bad blocks may exhibit a few key symptoms. Saving, reading, and moving files may result in failure; active applications may operate slowly or frequently crash; the user may receive prompts to repair the file system; and general performance may steadily decrease, especially when handling large files.
- If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing
- While somewhat less common, it is possible for SSDs to cease functioning except in read-only mode
## How to fix failed SSD:
- Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system.
- Power cycling the SSD
- Updating SSD firmware.
- Updating drivers.
# SSD protection best practices
- Download a program from a selection of existing free software options designed to monitor SSD health by tracking operating temperature and performance metrics.
- When investing in a new SSD, buy strategically. Many SSDs come equipped with S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) that warns users of potential failure and prompts them to take preventative measures.
- Have a backup strategy. Backup data regularly and routinely, even if your SSD was purchased recently and appears to be in good health.
