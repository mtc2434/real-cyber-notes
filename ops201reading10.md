# How to: Get started with Veeam Backup Free Edition Notes
# Why this matters
- It is important to back up your data, and Veeam provides yet another way to be able to recover states of your virtual machines.
# Analogy
- This is just like the snapshots in virtualbox, but it is 3rd party software that's compatible with other hypervisors instead of virtualbox's snapchat feature which is exclusive to itself from my understanding.
# Notes (used openai.com)
- "Download and Installation: Download the software, run the installer, accept license, choose components, configure installation settings."
- "Configuration: Add hypervisor servers, create backup repository, configure backup proxies, set up backup jobs for virtual machines."
- "Backup and Recovery: Run backup jobs, monitor progress, restore virtual machines from backup files."
- "Monitoring and Reporting: Monitor job status and statistics, generate reports, troubleshoot issues."
 -      (summary of what veeam backup is using openai.com)
 'Veeam Backup is a software application that allows you to create backups of virtual machines running on hypervisors like VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V. The software works by taking snapshots of virtual machines and storing them in backup repositories, which can be located on different types of storage devices such as hard drives, network attached storage (NAS), or cloud storage.'
