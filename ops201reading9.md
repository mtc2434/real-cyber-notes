# So, You Want to Write an SOP? Notes
## Why this matters
- SOPs matter because they help make everyone in a group stay on the same page
## Analogy
- When I was in the army every element of soldiers had their own SOPs to stay cohesive during training, like hand signals, how layouts would be organized, literally everything.
## Notes
- Readable. This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.
- Consumable. Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.
- Understandable. To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.
- Actionable. SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.
- Measurable. The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.
- Keep it simple. Keep in mind that especially at the Service Desk, the SOP is likely to be referenced while handling a customer contact. The SOP should augment and reinforce training; it is not a substitute for training.
- SOPs must be portable. Even if an underpinning application or tool is changed, the “what, when, and why” generally will not. This is why I use work instructions to map the SOP to the underpinning tool.
- Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story. People learn and interpret information in different ways. Some people like to read about how something should be done, others like to see “the big picture” and then read the details. Having a flowchart or diagrams (as appropriate) is a great way to quickly communicate what activities are addressed within the SOP.
- Consistency counts. Develop and use a consistent format or template to help make the SOP consumable.
- It’s about the audience. However you write your SOPs, keep in mind that you’re writing them for your audience. If the SOP does not work for your audience, your SOP doesn’t work. Conduct regular periodic reviews of SOPs with the people that use them to identify and incorporate improvements.
