# How to Use System Restore in Windows
## Why This Material Matters
-It is important to understand how to perform a system restore because it allows the user to experiment with different outcomes with software without having to start the system from scratch if something goes wrong. It saves human labor hours and computing time.
### Analogy
-Restoring a point in time for windows is like reloading a save in a video game. You will experiment a certain outcome if you perform a certain action. If the outcome is not to your liking, you can simply reload the save and try a different approach. This makes the consequences of bad outcome miniscule, cutting human labor hours down. 
## Things I want to know more about
1. 1.)What are some actions that I'd take that would force me to perform a system restore?
2. 2.)What would happen if I powered down the machine during a system restore? would the machine break? Only half of the files from before the restore point would be present? Would all the files be present?
