## What is Virtualization?
- Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something.” (Virtualization, 2017).
- The same model eventually extended from desktops and servers to also cover the network, storage, data devices, as well applications (through app virtualization – software encapsulation from the underlying operating system).

## Amazon cloud service model
- The Amazon IaaS cloud service model is characterized by delivering virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service.
-  It acts as a virtual machine manager that sits on top of the host system where all of the customer virtual machines run.
-  “In summary, cloud computing leverages virtualization technology to achieve the goal of providing computing resources as a utility.” (Zhang, Cheng, and Boutaba, 2010).
