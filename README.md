# Readings: Startup Sequences and BIOS NOTES
1. What is the BIOS?
- *Bios is a firmware that allows the user to manipulate settings of hardware  and loads the operating system into RAM*
2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
- *an analagy for the booting process would be a squad leader checking his soldier's ppe to make sure he is effective in the battlefield*
3. What is the “Power On Self Test”?
- *This makes sure all the hardware is compatible and there are no errors between systems before OS startup*
4. What is the CMOS?
- *CMOS is a series of components, creating a ship that stores very important data for the os during the booting process. The chip is non volatile*
5. What is the CMOS battery?
- *The battery that allows the CMOS chip to stay non volatile. Without the battery the chip reset data*
## Things I want to know more about
* How did the first person to develop BIOS pull it off? how do you even start making an inerface when you dont have one?
