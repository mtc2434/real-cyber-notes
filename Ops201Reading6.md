# Windows Defender Security Center in Windows 10 Notes
## Why This Matters
- Understanding Windows Defender Security Center can help protect and secure a machine's security settings. Being able to understand what changes are being made will ensure your desired security outcome will be smooth.
- "In Windows 10 v1709, you can use Controlled Folder Access to protect your data against ransomware attacks. You will find the settings here under Virus & threat protection section"
- "If an issue that requires your attention is found, you will see a yellow exclamation mark icon overlay on the shield icon"
- "Clicking on Open Troubleshooter opened the Hardware Troubleshooter. I ran it and a driver issue was fixed"
- "Windows Defender Security Center itself does not add any new features to Windows Defender but simply collects many of the pre-existing Windows security and privacy settings and makes them easily accessible to you" 
## Things I want to know more about
- How easy are these security systems to breach? 
- Can there be a security breach or issue in general that can go undetected even if notifications are on?
